# Women's Clothing Reviews Analysis Project
## 1. Project Definition
### This project aims to gain in-depth insights into product quality, customer satisfaction, recommendation trends, and product perceptions by analyzing a customer review dataset for a women's clothing retailer. The project will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand customer behavior, develop predictive models, and provide actionable insights for business decisions.

## 2. Project Purpose
### The main objectives of this project are:

* To analyze customer reviews to obtain concrete feedback on product and service quality.

* To identify factors influencing customer satisfaction and recommendation trends.

* To classify emotions within review texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

* To understand customer behavior through age, product type, and other variables.

* To develop predictive models using data science and machine learning techniques.

## 3. Scope
### The following main activities will be carried out within the scope of this project:

* Loading, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.

* Performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

* Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to review texts.

* Developing Recommendation Prediction and Sentiment Classification models.

* Conducting Customer Segmentation, Topic Modeling, and Text Similarity analyses.

* Reporting and presenting all findings.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1. Data Loading and Exploration
* The dataset will be loaded into an appropriate development environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

* The data structure will be thoroughly examined using commands like .head(), .info(), and .describe().

* Missing data and data types will be checked.

* The meaning and content of variables will be verified.

### 4.2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
### Missing Value Management: Missing (NaN) values in the Title and Review Text columns will be identified and addressed appropriately (decision to fill, delete, or leave as is).

### Text Data Cleaning:

* All texts will be converted to lowercase.

* Punctuation marks and special characters will be removed.

* Unnecessary spaces will be trimmed.

* Stopwords will be removed from the texts.

### New Feature Engineering: The length of review texts (e.g., review_length) will be calculated and added as a new numerical feature. Special characters or numbers will also be cleaned from the text if necessary.

### 4.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Basic Analytical Objectives)
* Rating Distribution and Recommendation Rate: The distribution of Rating and Recommended IND variables will be visualized (histogram, barplot); the relationship between ratings and Recommended IND (recommendation status) will be examined.

* Satisfaction by Age: The distribution of Yaş (Age) will be investigated; average ratings and recommendation rates by age group will be analyzed, and the correlation between age and recommendation rate will be explored.

* Positive Feedback Count: The distribution of Positive Feedback Count and which reviews were found most helpful will be analyzed; its connection to higher Rating and recommendation will be examined.

* Performance by Category: Customer recommendation and satisfaction rates based on product categories (Division, Department, Class) will be deeply investigated to determine which categories are more recommended or have higher dissatisfaction.

* Missing Data Analysis: The percentage of missing values in Title or Review Text fields will be identified, and the potential impact of missing data on analysis results will be interpreted.

### 4.4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Advanced Objectives
* Sentiment Analysis: Emotions (Positive, Negative, Neutral) within the Review Text will be classified. A basic classification model (e.g., TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) will be developed. For advanced levels, experiments with transfer learning models like BERT or RoBERTa can be conducted.

* Feature Engineering: Additional text features such as review length, uppercase ratio, and presence of question marks will be extracted to improve model performance.

* Recommendation Prediction: Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) will be developed to predict Recommended IND using engineered features (age, rating, vectorized review text, positive feedback count, etc.).

* Customer Segmentation: KMeans or another clustering algorithm will be applied using variables like Age, Rating, Recommendation Status, and text features to identify customer types (e.g., "young and critical customers", "middle-aged and loyal customers", "elderly and positive customers").

* Topic Modeling: Prominent themes or topics (e.g., “size”, “color”, “fabric”) will be extracted from review texts using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) or NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) methods. The composition of themes in terms of keywords and their intensity in specific reviews will be examined.

* Text Similarity / Clustering: Reviews with similar content will be clustered to form groups based on product categories or complaint types.

* Word Cloud & Keyword Analysis: Separate word clouds will be generated for positive and negative reviews. Frequently appearing positive/negative terms will be identified through frequency analysis.

## 5. Reporting and Presentation of Results
* All findings will be organized and supported by graphics and tables in a clear and understandable report document.

* Model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and recommendation results will be clearly articulated.

* Potential Visualizations: Barplot of age group vs. average rating, stacked bar chart of Recommended % by Department, scatterplot of Rating vs. Positive Feedback Count, word clouds of positive and negative reviews, and pie chart or histogram of sentiment scores distribution will be utilized.

* Challenges encountered throughout the project, lessons learned, and suggestions for future improvements or expansions (e.g., more data, different models, real-time analysis) will be noted.

## 6. Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python

* Core Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

* Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

* NLP Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn (for text cleaning, vectorization, basic classification)

* Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn (for classification, clustering), XGBoost (for classification), Gensim (for topic modeling)

* Advanced NLP (Optional): Transformers (for models like BERT, RoBERTa)

* Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
